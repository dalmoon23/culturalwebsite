                       <p>The first indigenous population in Mukah was the Melanau. 
                        The earliest written record of Mukah can be found in the annals of the 
                        Majapahit empire where a place known as "Melano" was paying tribute to the empire. 
                        In the 13th century, the region then joined the Bruneian Empire. Later, in 1860, 
                        Mukah was sold to the Raj of Sarawak.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Melanau community in Sarawak addresses a variety of topics pertaining to the Melanau people. These topics include the people's history and origins, family and kinship systems, social organisation, belief systems, customs and taboos, political systems and leadership, economic systems and activities, as well as their transformation and progress. These topics are discussed without omitting aspects of the Melanau people's history and life in the past. After the Iban and Malay peoples, the Melanau ethnic make up the fourth largest bumiputera population in Sarawak. The Bidayuh people are in fifth place. The Melanau community is a minority in Sarawak, making up only six percent of the total population, hence it is not well known outside of this state. There are around 2.4 million people that live in Sarawak.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        There is a common association between the Melanau people, the majority of whom live in Mukah, and the sago industry. The people of Melanau refer to themselves as a-likow, which means original or indigenous people. However, the term a-likow can also be used to refer to Melanau people who have not practised Islam or Christianity. The majority of them make their homes along the coast of Sarawak, between the cities of Kuala Rejang in the state's southwest and Kuala Baram in the northwestern part of the state.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        At least six different Melanau dialect groups exist today. Because the Melanau people do not have a standardised language or dialect, there is a notable distinction between the Melanau dialect spoken in Bintulu and the Melanau dialect spoken in Mukah or Rejang.  They speak English or Sarawak Malay to converse with one another. Melanau people are those who reside in the coastal region between Kuala Rejang and Kuala Baram, participate in Melanau cultural activities, speak the Melanau language, consume Melanau foods, and have a distinct Melanau identity. Additionally, Melanau people are distinguished by having a distinctive Melanau identity.
                        <br></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                        There are several different hypotheses concerning the past and the beginnings of Melanau. Some people claim that they are from the Philippines, while others are under the impression that they are from Java. On this subject, there has not been any research that is exhaustive and conclusive. It is thought that the inhabitants of Melanau have the same roots and beginnings as other indigenous peoples in the area upstream of the Sungai Rejang river. This is based on historical evidence.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If traced in terms of language, social organisation, belief system, and there are customs of the distinct races, there is justification to argue that they come from the same general region. There is a close relationship between them and some of the tribes that live in the interior, as evidenced by the similarities that exist in certain of their vocabulary, social hierarchies, death rituals, and medical practises.
                        They are frequently connected with the Kajaman, the Sekapan, the Lahanan, and perhaps the Kenyah and the Kayan. There are many who refer to the Melanau as Kayan Lalu. This is due to the fact that when the enemy invaded the area around the 18th or 19th century, they would just travel through a region to continue their voyage until they reached the seaside area. They do not settle down in one location like the Kayans who reside upstream of the Rejang River. They will not be protected from the danger posed by the adversary unless they move to an area along the coast.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Even though the Melanau people and the Malay people are completely distinct in every respect, they are frequently confused with one another. This kind of reaction is not unexpected given that the Malay people and the Melanau people do not significantly differ from one another in terms of their physical appearance, faces, or identities. In addition, the political climate of the moment renders these two races inseparable from one another.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Even though there are Melanau groups that are Christian and still cling to the traditional beliefs, the vast majority of Melanau people are Muslims. However, there are also Melanau communities that are Christians. Islam is the glue that holds the Malays and Melanaus together, making it impossible for people who are not from Sarawak to differentiate between the two groups. Intermarriage between Melanau and Malay people is another factor that contributes to the erosion of existing disparities.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Malay population lives along the shore, and the Dayak people live inland. The Melanau people are considered to be the "middle people" between these two groups. They find themselves in an awkward position between the two. The long history of conflict or relationship between them and the Malays in the lower reaches, and the Dayaks in the upper reaches, has more or less defined the face, identity, and culture of the Melanau people. The Malays lived in the lower reaches, and the Dayaks lived in the upper reaches. Despite this, they continue to identify as Melanau.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>The majority of Melanau people still take offence at being compared to Malay people. They take great pride in the fact that they are of Melanau ancestry. They follow a culture and set of practises that are entirely distinct from those of the Malay people; this is what differentiates them from the Malay people's own customs and culture, despite the fact that they share similarities in terms of religion and the political battles they face.</p>
