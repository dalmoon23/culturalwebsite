            <p>There are a few different accounts of where the name <b><i>"Mukah"</i></b> came from originally. The word <b>"face"</b> is referred to as <i>"muka"</i> in Malay, which is where the word <b><i>"mukah"</i></b> comes from. It was said that the visage of a mysterious and lovely woman who aided three shipwrecked merchants from Brunei inspired the naming of the town. Another account of the event stated that fisherman witnessed the apparition of a lovely face on the water's surface. Despite this, there is no explanation given as to why the town chose to call itself by a Malay name rather than a Melanau name, despite the fact that Melanau people make up the majority of the population here. The word "jawai" comes from the Melanau language and means "face."
            The significance of the fishing industry to the town of Mukah is symbolised by the presence of statues of the red snapper <i>(Ikan Merah)</i> and the prawn <i>(Udang)</i>, respectively.</p>

            <p>The Melanau people are the oldest known indigenous population to have inhabited the Mukah region. The first documentation of Mukah can be found in the annals of the Majapahit empire, where a place known as "Melano" was paying tribute to the empire. In those annals, Mukah is referred to as a place that paid tribute. After that, in the 13th century, the region was incorporated into the Bruneian Empire as a component of Brunei. After that, in the year 1860, Mukah was sold to the Raj of Sarawak.
                The Batang Mukah Bridge is undoubtedly one of the most iconic monuments in the entire city of Mukah.
                After a fierce naval fight off the coast of Mukah in November 1862, the Rajah Muda was able to save a number of villagers who were being held captive by Moro Pirates. During the battle, the Rainbow, a steamer owned by Brooke, was responsible for sinking four prahus and damaging another with her cannon fire. During the conflict, about a hundred pirates lost their lives or were injured, but Brooke, Bishop Francis McDougall, and the Sarawakians who followed them escaped with relatively minor injuries.</p>
